Google Data Analytics Capstone Project
# SCENARIO
You are a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. You have been at your job for six months, and your boss
feels you are ready for more responsibility. He has asked you to lead a project for a brand new client â€” this will involve everything
from dening the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask
the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and
prepare a presentation

To complete this Capstone Project I will be following the data analysis process: ASK, PREPARE, PROCESS, ANALYZE, SHARE, and ACT

# ASK

Which TikTok influencer is the most effective at reaching their audience.
